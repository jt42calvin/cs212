# cs212
This repo is a dump of all my projects from CS212 - Data Structures & Algorithms.

Program 1 tests different time complexities of algorithms and graphs them using Microsoft Excel to visually see how time complexities scale as inputs get larger over time.

Program 2 is a simple text file scrambler that uses a hash table to mix up the sentences of popular books and stories. Includes a modifier to mix more words at a time.

Program 3 is a GUI based project that uses recursion to create a fractal fern. Included are demo screenshots.

Program 4 is a text based "Dutch Bingo" simulator. With thousands of different people with many ways to relate them all to each other, you can find how you are related to people far out.

Program 5 is an AI Mancala player that competed in a school tournament. It uses a Minimax algorithm and recursive tree to solve problems and think ahead. My AI bot reached the semifinals. Included are demo screenshots.
